# Burger Eater

Burger Eater is my first full-stack web app with a front end implemented with HTML/CSS and Handlebars and the backend implemented with Node.js and Express . With this app you can create a new burger which is stored in my database, change the burger from "Fresh" to "To Go" or delete the burger using the "Send Back" button


## Demo

The demo of the burger eating application can be found [here](https://limitless-coast-93605.herokuapp.com/).
